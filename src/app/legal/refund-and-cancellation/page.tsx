          Yes, you can, but have in mind the traveller or the organization might
          have already bought a plane ticket or bus ticket or any other pre-trip
          expenses may have already been incurred and organized his or her trip
          in order to help you. Last-minute cancellations are very harmful and
          may cost you all the expenses incurred along with some extra
          compensation for all the inconvenience, so we recommend you to get in
          contact with us through email at support@volunteeryatra.com as soon as
          possible or at least 7-10 days before the trip.

        <h1>Is the traveller allowed to cancel with the host?</h1>
        <p className="mt-5">
          Yes, just as the host, the traveller can also cancel by getting in
          contact with us through email at support@volunteeryatra.com as soon as
          possible or at least 7-10 days before the trip. If the traveller
          cancels the trip, they lose any fee paid.

            In order to cancel a trip, our team will take a closer look at the
            current situation after talking to both the host and the traveller
            and then take any suitable decision which seems best for all of
            those involved. Our first priority would be to resolve the matter in
            order to continue the trip.
