          Hey guys! I’m Nehul and through this blog, I will be sharing with you
          the beautiful and immersive experience of being a Yatri. I visited the
          permaculture project near Shimla as a travel volunteer. The moment we
          entered the premises, I was captivated by the abundant natural beauty
          that surrounded me-the oak and pine forests, the apple orchard belt,
          the wild strawberries growing everywhere and so much more. In fact, we
          even had the liberty of plucking and tasting those exotic strawberries
          anytime. That was so much fun.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          {" "}
          But you know, it wasn’t all about the natural beauty, there was much
          more to that. I witnessed a harmonious coexistence between animals,
          plants and humans; a sight very rare in our day to day city lives.
          There was a deeper understanding shared between the residents of the
          place and their natural surroundings. They tended to their farms and
          kitchen gardens; growing their food themselves and directly consuming
          it. I witnessed a very raw relationship between the host community and
          nature. Furthermore, the people were extremely kind, content with
          their lives and very hardworking.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          During my stay there, I learnt what growing one’s own food feels like
          and spent some amazing moments with the farm animals there. The
          property had three ducks, two cats, one dog, one sheep, one rooster,
          two hens and one chick. I was greeted every morning by the dog, the
          sheep, and the hens would always be around my room. Sometimes, the cat
          would come and sleep with us. The whole experience of sharing my space
          with animals was so wholesome and unlike anything that I had ever
          experienced in the city. Just observing those adorable darlings,
          petting them once in a while and being around them helped develop a
          deeper bond with them; a bond which brought me peace, satisfaction and
          contentment. I really miss those moments!{" "}
        </p>

          {" "}
          Hailing from Delhi, I witnessed a huge difference in the lifestyle of
          the people living here. I developed a good connection with the
          community and had meaningful conversations with them as well as with
          other volunteers. Apart from my volunteering activities, my volunteer
          friends and I would spend the day chilling around and playing with the
          animals. My time as a volunteer helped me develop a deeper connection
          with the food I consume, and a greater appreciation for the hard work,
          patience and care that goes into growing that food- the journey from
          sowing a seed to the cooked food on our plate. After intimately
          engaging with these processes, I am more grateful for each bite that I
          eat than I have ever been. And last but not the least, seeing
          prospective meals come out from a plant whose seeds you sowed is a
          magnificent and humbling experience- a much needed experience for
          every human.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          To my fellow humans and future Yatris, I would like to say that there
          is nothing more that I would like to change or add to my experience.
          It was perfect and absolutely mesmerising. It was my pleasure to be a
          part of the meaningful initiatives that Volunteer Yatra is
          undertaking. By bridging the gap between urban and the rural spaces,
          they are greatly contributing to sustainable development and thus to a
          better future for all of us. We’ve got one Earth, let’s save it and
          preserve it so that we can keep it’s wonders alive. Be a Yatri and go
          learn with an open heart and an open mind. You would really enjoy
          yourselves. That’s all folks!
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          My experience with Volunteer Yatra has been extremely fun and
          engaging. I received the promised services and the safety of the
          volunteers was taken into account. I received the hospitality I was
          hoping for and the experience brought me closer to my natural
          counterparts. It was a liberating, adventurous and informational
          experience which made me rethink the manner in which we spend our
          lives in the cities. I appreciate the initiatives taken by Volunteer
          Yatra and I was happy to be a part of it :){" "}
